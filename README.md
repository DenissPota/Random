# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server 


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8010/  

### Additional features:
1)  This server uses [MapStruct](http://mapstruct.org/) to create mappings between Swagger-generated model
classes and entities that will be mapped to the Domain database.

### Additional remarks:
1) Although Swagger-generated part and implemented part are decoupled as much as possible, Spring boot runner
class has additional annotations to support scanning through all components.
2)  Springfox has a dependency to mapstruct library prior to jdk-8. That's why it has to be excluded in pom.xml file.

```xml
 <dependency>
            <groupId>io.springfox</groupId>
            <artifactId>springfox-swagger2</artifactId>
            <version>${springfox-version}</version>
            <exclusions>
                <exclusion>
                    <groupId>org.mapstruct</groupId>
                    <artifactId>mapstruct</artifactId>
                </exclusion>
            </exclusions>
        </dependency>
```

### How to run?

```
mvn clean install
java -jar /target/swagger-spring-1.0.0.jar
Go to: http://localhost:8010/ 
```
